Revision history for Perl extension PDF::Reuse::OverlayChart.

0.03  Fri Oct 28 2005
      Added two new parameters, initialMaxY and initialMinY, to be used when you want to
      force the module to start with specific values along the y-axis. 
      Corrected two small bugs. (And used another method from Finance::QuoteHist in the
      example how to mix graphs. The first method used, seem to have been removed.)

      Everything with JavaScript is removed from the documentation, as some methods with 
      JavaScript do not work under Acrobat 7.0
